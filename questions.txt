What is the general trend in the curve?
The general trend of the curve is positive.

Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?
The curve is a little noisy but parts of it don't really look noisier than others. This
is because the less of the data that is used for training will cause the curve to look noisier. 
The curve gets smoother as there is more training data used.

How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
You would probably need more than 100 trials to get a smooth curve.

Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10** -10)). What happens?
If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation
for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn
When you make the C greater, you need less training data for the same amount of accuracy.
